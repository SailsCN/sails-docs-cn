# Controllers

### Overview

Controllers (the **C** in **MVC**) are the principle objects in your Sails application that are responsible for responding to *requests* from a web browser, mobile application or any other system capable of communicating with a server.  They often act as a middleman between your [models](./#!documentation/reference/models) and [views](./#!documentation/reference/views). For many applications, the controllers will contain the bulk of your project&rsquo;s [business logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic).

### Actions
Controllers are comprised of a collection of methods called *actions*.  Action methods can be bound to [routes](./#!documentation/reference/routes) in your application so that when a client requests the route, the bound method is executed to perform some business logic and (in most cases) generate a response.  For example, the `GET /hello` route in your application could be bound to a method like:

```javascript
function (req, res) {
  return res.send("Hi there!");
}
```

so that any time a web browser is pointed to the `/hello` URL on your app's server, the page displays the message &ldquo;Hi there&rdquo;.

### Where are Controllers defined?
Controllers are defined in the `api/controllers/` folder. You can put any files you like in that folder, but in order for them to be loaded by Sails as controllers, a file must *end* in `Controller.js`.  By convention, Sails controllers are usually [*Pascal-cased*](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PascalCase), so that every word in the filename (including the first word) is capitilized: for example, `UserController.js`, `MyController.js` and `SomeGreatBigController.js` are all valid, Pascal-cased names.

You may organize your controllers into groups by saving them in subfolders of `api/controllers`, however note that the subfolder name *will become part of the Controller&rsquo;s identity* when used for routing (more on that in the "Routing" section below).

### What does a Controller file look like?
A controller file defines a Javascript object whose keys are action names, and whose values are the corresponding action methods.  Here&rsquo;s a simple example of a full controller file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  hi: function (req, res) {
    return res.send("Hi there!");
  },
  bye: function (req, res) {
    return res.redirect("http://www.sayonara.com");
  }
};
```

This controller defines two actions: the &ldquo;hi&rdquo; responds to a request with a string message, while the &ldquo;bye&rdquo; action responds by redirecting to another web site.  The `req` and `res` objects will be familiar to anyone who has used [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) to write a web application.  This is by design, as Sails uses Express under the hood to handle routing.  Take special note, however, of the lack of a `next` argument for the actions.  Unlike Express  middleware methods, Sails controller actions should always be the last stop in the request chain--that is, they should always result in either a response or an error.  While it is possible to use `next` in an action method, you are strongly encouraged to use [policies](./#!documentation/reference/policies) instead wherever possible.

### Routing

By default, Sails will create a [blueprint action route](./#!documentation/reference/blueprints) for each action in a controller, so that a `GET` request to `/:controllerIdentity/:nameOfAction` will trigger the action.  If the example controller in the previous section was saved as `api/controllers/SayController.js`, then the `/say/hi` and `/say/bye` routes would be made available by default whenever the app was lifted.  If the controller was saved under the subfolder `/we`, then the routes would be `/we/say/hi` and `/we/say/bye`.  See the [blueprints documentation](./#!documentation/reference/blueprints) for more information about Sails&rsquo; automatic route binding.

Besides the default routing, Sails allows you to manually bind routes to controller actions using the [`config/routes.js`]() file.  Some examples of when you might want to use explicit routes are:

+ When you want to use separate actions to handle the same route path, based on the [HTTP method](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) (aka verb).  The aforementioned **action blueprint** routes bind *all* request methods for a path to a given action, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.
+ When you want an action to be available at a custom URL (e.g. `PUT /login`, `POST /signup`, or a "vanity URL" like `GET /:username`)
+ When you want to set up additional options for how the route should be handled (e.g. special CORS configuration)

To manually bind a route to a controller action in the `config/routes.js` file, you can use the HTTP verb and path (i.e. the **route address**) as the key, and the controller name + `.` + action name as the value (i.e. the **route target**).

For example, the following manual route will cause your app to trigger the `makeIt()` action in `api/controllers/SandwichController.js` whenever it receives POST a request to `/make/a/sandwich`:

```js
  'POST /make/a/sandwich': 'SandwichController.makeIt'
```


> **Note:**
>
> For controller files saved in subfolders, the subfolder is part of the controller identity:
>
> ```js
>   '/do/homework': 'stuff/things/HomeworkController.do'
> ```
>
> This will cause the `do()` action in `api/controllers/stuff/things/HomeworkController.js` to be triggered whenever `/do/homework` is requested.

A full discussion of manual routing is out of the scope of this doc--please see the [routes documentation](./#!documentation/reference/routes) for a full overview of the available options.



### Generating controllers

You can use the [Sails command line tool](./#!documentation/reference/CommandLine) to quickly generate a controller, by typing:

```sh
$ sails generate controller <controller name> [action names separated by spaces...]
```

For example, if you run the following command:

```sh
$ sails generate controller comment create destroy tag like
info: Generated a new controller `comment` at api/controllers/CommentController.js!
```

Sails will generate `api/controllers/CommentController.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * CommentController.js 
 *
 * @description :: Server-side logic for managing comments.
 */

module.exports = {
	
  /**
   * CommentController.create()
   */
  create: function (req, res) {
    return res.json({
      todo: 'Not implemented yet!'
    });
  },

  /**
   * CommentController.destroy()
   */
  destroy: function (req, res) {
    return res.json({
      todo: 'Not implemented yet!'
    });
  },

  /**
   * CommentController.tag()
   */
  tag: function (req, res) {
    return res.json({
      todo: 'Not implemented yet!'
    });
  },

  /**
   * CommentController.like()
   */
  like: function (req, res) {
    return res.json({
      todo: 'Not implemented yet!'
    });
  }
};
```
