# myApp/api/policies
### Purpose
This is the folder you will store your `policy` files in.  A policy file is a .js file that contains what is essentially express middleware for authenticating access to controller actions in your app.  

If you want to make sure only the user `rick1983` can access `http://prism.gov/rick1983` , this is the folder you would put that logic in.
