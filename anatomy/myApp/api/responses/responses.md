# myApp/api/responses
### Purpose

This folder holds the logic for issuing server responses to your clients.

When you generate a new Sails project, we include some of the more common ones for you. Feel free to edit them to suit your needs.  You can also create a custom response using our `sails-generate-custom-response` generator.

See the Response section of Reference Documentation for more info.
