# myApp/api/models/.gitkeep
### Purpose

Ignore this file.  It only exists because `git` refuses to push empty directories to a remote server.  `.gitkeep` is an unofficial convention that has emerged as a workaround for people who don't discriminate against empty directories.

忽略这个文件。这个文件存在主要是因为“git”服务器端拒绝push空文件夹 “.gitkeep”是一个非官方的形式实针对工作区的空文件夹
